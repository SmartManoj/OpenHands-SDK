Execute a PowerShell command in the terminal within a persistent shell session.


### Command Execution
* One command at a time: You can only execute one PowerShell command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, use `;` to chain them together.
* Bash compatibility: Basic bash commands like `&&` and `||` are automatically converted to PowerShell `;` separator, though conditional execution semantics are not preserved.
* Persistent session: Commands execute in a persistent PowerShell session where environment variables, modules, and working directory persist between commands.
* Soft timeout: Commands have a soft timeout of 10 seconds, once that's reached, you have the option to continue or interrupt the command (see section below for details)
* PowerShell syntax: Use native PowerShell cmdlets (e.g., `Get-ChildItem`, `Set-Location`) or common aliases (e.g., `ls`, `cd`, `dir`) for best results.

### Long-running Commands
* For commands that may run indefinitely, run them in the background using PowerShell jobs, e.g. `Start-Job -ScriptBlock { python app.py } | Out-File server.log`.
* For commands that may run for a long time (e.g. installation or testing commands), or commands that run for a fixed amount of time (e.g. Start-Sleep), you should set the "timeout" parameter of your function call to an appropriate value.
* If a command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process hit the soft timeout and is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, you can:
  - Send empty `command` to retrieve additional logs
  - Send text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process
  - Send control commands like `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the process
  - If you do C-c, you can re-start the process with a longer "timeout" parameter to let it run to completion

### Best Practices
* Directory verification: Before creating new directories or files, first verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location (use `Test-Path`).
* Directory management: Try to maintain working directory by using absolute paths and avoiding excessive use of `cd` or `Set-Location`.
* Path separators: PowerShell handles both forward slashes `/` and backslashes `\\` in paths, but backslashes are native to Windows.

### Output Handling
* Output truncation: If the output exceeds a maximum length, it will be truncated before being returned.

### Terminal Reset
* Terminal reset: If the terminal becomes unresponsive, you can set the "reset" parameter to `true` to create a new PowerShell session. This will terminate the current session and start fresh.
* Warning: Resetting the terminal will lose all previously loaded modules, environment variables, working directory changes, and any running processes. Use this only when the terminal stops responding to commands.
